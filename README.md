## Shared answers

Without Supabase keys in `js/config.js`, the published site runs in **demo mode** (answers stay in that browser). To collect a real shared roster:

1. Create a free Supabase project
2. Run `supabase/schema.sql`
3. Insert leadership emails into `leaders`
4. Put the project URL and anon key in `js/config.js`
